# Simple AI Todolist mobile app

This project is a proof of concept on how we can use AI to categorize our daily tasks. it uses PostgreSQL as a database where we can store user credintials for user auth, user lists and the AI generated vector embeddings. With the use of a few edge functions this app converts the catagories and tasks into vector embeddings with the help of edge functions. Using one of those edge functions it compares the embeddings and sorts the tasks based on similarity.
